# Understanding Mechanistic Role of Structural and Functional Connectivity in Tau Propagation Through Multi-Layer Modeling



# üìä Statistical Models

This folder contains MATLAB scripts for statistical analysis of tau propagation patterns across the brain using structural and functional connectivity, gene expression, and demographic factors. Each script targets a specific aspect of modeling, correlation, or group difference testing.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

### `GAM.m`
Fits **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** to model the effect of **age**, **sex**, and **subject ID** on tau SUVR values across ROIs.

- Outputs:
  - Partial age effects per ROI
  - ROI-wise p-values (model comparison: with vs. without age term)

---

### `corrNeighbor_tau.m`
Computes correlations between regional tau accumulation and the **mean tau of its neighbors** (based on FC or SC).

- Outputs:
  - ROI-wise adjusted R and p-values
  - Regression plots

---

### `corrNeighbor_lobes.m`
Analyzes **lobe-level associations** between each region‚Äôs tau and the mean tau in neighbors from each **7** or **13** cortical system.

- Outputs:
  - 7√ó7 and 13√ó13 correlation matrices
  - FDR-corrected p-values
  - Correlation heatmap visualizations

---

### `gene_us_uf_analysis.m`
Explores associations between **gene expression patterns** and tau propagation differences in **US vs. UF regions**.

- Likely includes:
  - Gene-wise correlation or regression with propagation metrics

---

### `lasso_gengens.m`
Performs **non-negative LASSO regression with bootstrapping** to identify genes associated with tau propagation patterns.

- Outputs:
  - Stability path plots
  - Selection frequency matrix
  - Top-ranked gene list

---

### `mixed_model_group_diff.m`
Applies **linear mixed-effects models** to test group differences (e.g., AD vs. CN) in tau propagation, accounting for subject-level variability.

- Suitable for:
  - Longitudinal or hierarchical data
  - Repeated-measures tau SUVR analysis

---

### `us_uf_sex_apoe.m`
Stratified analysis of tau propagation in **US vs. UF regions** across **sex** and **APOE genotype**.

- Outputs:
  - Interaction effects
  - Group-level comparisons

---

## üìù Notes

- Make sure required inputs (e.g., SC/FC matrices, tau SUVR files, region labels, gene data) are available in the appropriate paths.
- Output results are typically saved to `Results/` or `Gene_results/` directories.
- Scripts assume MATLAB R2021a+ with `fitrgam`, `fitlme`, etc.

# üß† SC-FC Multi-layer Tau Propagation Model

This folder contains the implementation of the **closed-loop feedback multi-layer neural transport model** for tau propagation modeling, as illustrated in **Fig. 9** of the manuscript.

## üîç Overview

The model integrates:

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** to extract network-informed features from structural and functional connectivity
- **Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR)** for feedback control over propagation dynamics
- **PDE-based transport modeling** for SC-specific and FC-specific tau diffusion
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** for prediction of tau accumulation at the next time point

## üß± Key Components

- `GCN_layers.py` ‚Äì Graph convolutional layers for SC/FC networks  
- `control_constrints.py` ‚Äì Feedback control using LQR  
- `model_prediction.py` ‚Äì Core model forward propagation combining PDE solver and control  
- `train.py` ‚Äì Training script with loss functions and optimizer  
- `dataset.py` ‚Äì Custom dataset loader for input SUVRs and network matrices  
- `5fold.py` ‚Äì Cross-validation framework  
- `utils.py` ‚Äì Helper functions for training, evaluation, etc.  
- `optimal_control/` & `wirings/` ‚Äì Additional modules for control system implementation and parameter setup

## üì• Input

- Baseline tau SUVR vector `x‚Å∞`
- SC and FC adjacency matrices `F and S`

## üì§ Output
